# MBA Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of key projects completed as part of my Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Finance & Analytics. These files represent a mix of group and individual work, including a rural immersion study, a finance mini-project, and my final major project.

## Projects Included

### 1. Rural Immersion Programme
**File:** `Rural Immersion project.pdf`

A third-semester MBA group report from a Rural Immersion Programme. This project presents a detailed fieldwork study of Pothabolu Village, analyzing its socio-economic profile, agricultural practices, local economy, education systems, infrastructure, and the real-world impact of various government schemes.

### 2. Finance Mini Project (Investor Behaviour)
**File:** `finance mini project.pdf`

This mini-project, titled "**A Study on Analysis of Investors Behaviour Towards Selected Investment Avenues Available in India**," analyzes the preferences of individual investors. It examines popular options like shares, mutual funds, and fixed deposits, using primary data to understand investor motivations, risk tolerance, and key decision-making factors.

### 3. Full Major Project (Financial Literacy)
**File:** `FULL MAJOR PROJECT.pdf`

This is the final MBA major project, "**A Study on Financial Literacy Among the Professional Students in Madanapalle Revenue Division**." [cite_start]This research assesses the financial knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of students in professional courses like MBA, MCA, and Engineering[cite: 711].

* [cite_start]**Key Finding:** Using a sample of 184 students [cite: 497][cite_start], the study found that while overall financial literacy is "generally low" [cite: 499, 1505][cite_start], a high percentage (70.1%) of students are interested in taking a financial course if offered[cite: 911, 1463].
* [cite_start]**Methodology:** The analysis was performed using statistical tools like the **Chi-Square test, Correlation, and Regression** [cite: 498, 740, 741, 742] to test hypotheses.
* [cite_start]**Analysis:** The project explores the link between demographics and literacy, revealing that a student's **educational qualification** has a significant association with their financial knowledge[cite: 1305, 1475]. [cite_start]Conversely, factors like **gender and age** were found to have no significant association[cite: 1286, 1296, 1473, 1474]. [cite_start]The project concludes with strong recommendations for integrating practical financial education into the college curriculum[cite: 1490, 1492].
